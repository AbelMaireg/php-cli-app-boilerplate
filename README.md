# PHP CLI Project

This is a PHP command-line interface (CLI) project built on Linux system, designed with a focus on clean code, testing, and linting. It uses Composer for dependency management, PHPUnit for testing, and PHP_CodeSniffer for code style enforcement.

## Project Structure

```

- **`bin/`**: Contains the `cli.php` script, the entry point for running the CLI app.
- **`.gitignore`**: Ignores `vendor/` to avoid committing dependencies.
- **`src/`**: Holds the core application code, including the `App` class (main app logic).
- **`tests/`**: Contains PHPUnit test cases.
- **`config/`**: Placeholder for configuration files (not used in this example).
- **`vendor/`**: Auto-generated by Composer for dependencies.
- **`composer.json`**: Defines dependencies and PSR-4 autoloading.
- **`phpunit.xml`**: Configures PHPUnit for running tests.
- **`phpcs.xml`**: Configures PHP_CodeSniffer for linting.
- **`Makefile`**: Simplifies running, testing, and linting commands.

## Tools Used

- **PHP**: The runtime environment for the CLI application (version 8.4.8 or compatible).
- **Composer**: Dependency management and autoloading tool.
- **PHPUnit**: Testing framework for unit tests (installed via Composer).
- **PHP_CodeSniffer**: Linting tool to enforce PSR-12 coding standards.
- **Make**: Task runner for executing common commands (`run`, `test`, `lint`).
- **Git**: Version control for tracking code changes.

## Prerequisites

- Linux system with `php` and `composer` installed:

  **Arch Linux**:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -Syu
  sudo pacman -S php composer
  ```
  
  **Ubuntu/Debian**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install php-cli composer
  ```

  **Homebrew (macOS)**:
  ```bash
  brew install php composer
  ```

  **Windows**:
  ```
  You are on your own, but you can use WSL or install PHP and Composer manually.
  ```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url> my-php-project
   cd my-php-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Generate Autoloader**:
   If you modify `composer.json`, run:
   ```bash
   composer dump-autoload
   ```

## Running the Project

- **Run the CLI App**:
  ```bash
  make run
  ```
  Output: `Hello from my PHP CLI app!`

- **Run Unit Tests**:
  ```bash
  make test
  ```
  Runs PHPUnit tests in `tests/`. Expects output like:
  ```
  OK (6 tests, 10 assertions)
  ```

- **Lint the Code**:
  ```bash
  make lint
  ```

- **Format the Code**:
  ```bash
  make format
  ```

  Checks `src/` for PSR-12 compliance using PHP_CodeSniffer.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Dependencies**: Run `composer install` if `vendor/` is missing.
- **Linting Errors**: Ensure PHPDoc comments are present for files, classes, and methods.
- **Test Failures**: Check `tests/` for correct assertions and namespace usage.
- **Autoloading Issues**: Run `composer dump-autoload` if classes are not found.
